# FDM-Dervatives-Pricing

# Derivatives Pricing Project

## Description
This project implements various methods for pricing financial derivatives, such as options, using numerical methods like the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Monte Carlo simulations. It also includes the Black-Scholes analytical solution for comparison.

## Structure
- `fdm_pricing.py`: Implements FDM for option pricing.
- `monte_carlo.py`: Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing.
- `black_scholes.py`: Black-Scholes model for option pricing.
- `database.py`: MongoDB integration for saving and retrieving pricing data.
- `main.py`: Runs the models and compares their outputs.

## Installation
To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
